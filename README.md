Class name: com.epam.rd.java.basic.practice1.Part7

_______________________

Columns of spreadsheets (like Excel) have letter numbering in the form of latin capital letters (sequentially, from left to right):

A, B, ..., Y, Z, AA, AB, ..., AY, AZ, BA, BB, …, etc.

At the same time, each column has its sequence number: A - 1; B - 2; ... ; Y - 25; Z - 26; AA - 27; AB - 28; …, etc.

Write a class that contains the following three methods:

- a method of defining the column sequence number by its letter number 

[ public static int str2int(String number): A => 1; B => 2; ...; Z => 26; AA => 27; AB => 28; ... ];

- a method of defining the column letter number by its sequence number

[ public static String int2str(int number): 1 => A; 2 => B; ...; 26 => Z; 27 ==> AA; 28 ==> AB; ... ];

- using the column letter number, write a method of defining the number of the column that is placed on the right side of the given one.

[ public static String rightColumn(String number): A => B; B => C; ...; Y => Z; Z => AA; AA => AB; …].

The methods functionality is to be checked using the following data: 

—————————————————————————————————————

A ==> 1 ==> A

B ==> 2 ==> B

Z ==> 26 ==> Z

AA ==> 27 ==> AA

AZ ==> 52 ==> AZ

BA ==> 53 ==> BA

ZZ ==> 702 ==> ZZ

AAA ==> 703 ==> AAA
